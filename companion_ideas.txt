# Companion Ideas for Antimatter Dimensions Mod

theoretical

to be implemented now (when removing something from here, make sure to add it below, unless it is just a minor bug fix)
{
    parry system:
    - unlocks when reaching score 300+ in dino game
    - parry by pressing space while holding shift.
    - the next 4 frames the player glows light blue and when colling in that time, the obstacle hit by the player disappears.
    - parrying gives the player one score point, and starts a combo counter that goes up by one for every obtacle destroyes consecutively.
    - dodging an obtacle ends the combo.
    - parrying gives 1 * 2^combo score points.
}   

already implemented (after implementing something, move it here)
{
    1-5 star system with gacha like summons. summons use cookies. there are 3 types of summoning levels:
    basic: costs 1 cookies, can give 1 star to 3 star companion. (90% one star, 9% two stars, 1% three stars)

    the effects should all be easily scalable, so the companions can be leveled up:
    - antimatter production x1.5 (+0.1 per level up)
    - tickspeed x 1.1 (+0.02 per level up)
    - AD x10 buy multiplier +5% (+1% per level up)
    - cookie gain +10% (+2% per level up)
    after first big crunch:
    - infinities x2 (+0.4 per level up) (tier 2)
    - IP gain x2 (+0.4 per level up) (tier 2)
    - start each crunch with one free antimatter galaxy (not included in cost scaling) (+1 on level 5, +1 on level 10)
    - while running the dino game, cookie seeds grow 1*score% faster (+0.2*score% per level up)
    unlocked from the start:
    

    when hovering over a companion, it shows the effects it has.
    
    tier 2 effects take up 2 effect slots. the summoning effect rolling work the following:
    it first rolls for the amount of stars. the amount of stars determines the effect points available in total. then it rolls for the first effect.
    that roll can return any unlocked effect that costs the same or less than the amount of available points. it adds that effect and then deducts the effects cost from the points.
    if the points are 0, it stops. if the points are >0, it rolls again for another effect, with the same rules. 
    
    the companions tab unlocks after buying the first dimboost, the farm minigame after the first antimatter galaxy. the dino game is available from the start.

    higher stars can get the same effect multiple times, if that happens, they combine to one.
    basic summoning cost raised to 10 cookies.
    cookie multipliers apply to the L+E+O cheat as well.
    mighty summoning (10k cookies, 3-5 stars).
    farm changes: precise planting mode, hire grandma (100 cookies, auto-harvest, 50% tax), seed rot (1%).
    refinements: removed grandma text notification, clear tool, bigger grandma icon, rot persistence, layout fixes.
    farm changes: precise planting mode, hire grandma (100 cookies, auto-harvest, 50% tax), seed rot (1%).
    refinements: removed grandma text notification, clear tool, bigger grandma icon, rot persistence, layout fixes.
    bug fixes & features: fixed rot auto-replant bug, added grandma death (1% chance).
    grandma mechanics: disable auto-replant (manual plant required), tombstones on death, improved visibility.
    death messages: implemented 70/20/10% split for common/rare/very rare messages.

    common: (70%)
    "grandma died of old age"
    rare: (20%)
    "grandma fell from a high place"
    "grandma was eaten by a dragon"
    "grandma tried to swim in lava"
    "grandma got run over by a truck"
    very rare: (10%)
    "grandma was not ready for the wall of flesh"
    "grandma was not the imposter"
    "grandma was the imposter"
    "grandma watched too much brainrot"
    "grandma got yeeted into space"
    "grandma challenged Leo to a 1v1"
    "grandma got cancelled"

    - grandmas steal less cookies (can be bought 5 times, reduces from every 2. to every 3. to 4. t0 5. to 6. or 7 [it's randomly 6 or 7 every time] to none) (cost starts at 100 cookies, doubles every step)
    - grandmas die less often (can be bought 5 times, reduces from 1% to 0.8% to 0.6% to 0.4% to 0.2% to 0%) (cost starts at 100 cookies, doubles every step)
    - reduces seed rot chance (can be bought 5 times, reduces from 1% to 0.8% to 0.6% to 0.4% to 0.2% to 0%) (cost starts at 100 cookies, doubles every step)
    - unlock fastfalling in dino game (cost: 1k cookies)
    - unlock double jump in dino game (cost: 10k cookies)
    - start each run at score 100 in dino game (make sure it starts at the right speed as well) (cost 5000 cookies)
    - tickspeed upgrades have a highly reduced effect on seed growth (0.1% faster per upgrade [multiplicative]) (cost 100k cookies)
    - galaxies increase cookie gain by 50% each (cost 1m cookies)

    when reaching a highscore of 100+ in the dino game, a secret subtab should be unlocked.
    this subtab shows a keyboard where every button can be pressed by clicking it. when clicking
    when a button on this keyboard is clicked, it is displayed as held down until it is clicked again. if a button is
    displayed as held down, it treats it as if that key is pressed for hotkeys and stuff. make sure this applies 
    even when the game is not in focus. also above the keyboard it should have a button to press to view the hotleys
    (thuis page already exists and can be accessed from the settings, you just have to link it)

        companion filters: adds a block field under companion effect list on the right to setup filters.
    the filter can be set to whitelist or blacklist.
    the filter can be set to any or all
    there are lists for star numbers, effects and tiers, where each value can be selected or unselected.
    there is a button to delete manually.
    the filter can be set to automatic or manual. 
    when set to manual blacklist all for example, the delete button
    the button deletes every companion that fits all the filter criteria. 
    when it is set to automatic blacklist all, it does the same, but it does it immediately when summoning.
    automatic only applies to newly summoned companions.
    when it is set to whitelist all, it deletes every companion that does not fulfill all the filter criteria.
    when set to automatic whitelist any, it automaticially deletes every companion that does not fulfill any of the filter criteria.
    when for example, 4 star and 5 star are selected on the star count list, every 4 or 5 star companion counts as passing this criteria.
    the same logic applies to all other cases
